    <center><h2>What is Pawright?</h2></center>
    <center> <p>Pawright aims to help families looking to adopt a dog in Singapore narrow down their options based on their current living situation and lifestyle.<br>
    Just answer 5 simple questions to generate a list of dogs that you might like to meet at your local shelter!</p></center>

  <div class="box">
    <center><h2>Who are the dogs featured on Pawright?</h2></center>
    <center> <p>Pawright brings together dogs from three different shelters (more to come!):<br>
      <ul>
        <li> <b> Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD)</li> <br>
        <li>Save Our Street Dogs (SOSD)</li><br>
        <li>Singapore Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)</li></b></ul> 
      </ul>

      <center>These dogs are mostly "Singapore Specials" - they are our local-breed street dogs who, while not having any specific common characteristics like
       purebreds or crossbreeds, are known for being highly intelligent, athletic, and sensitive. (Also allergic to chicken, for some reason.)<br>
       <p>Some have come off the streets, as part of the Trap Neuter Release Monitor (TNRM) scheme that helps to control stray breeding, because they seem to like people
       and would be in danger if they continued living as strays.<br>  
       Others are returned to shelters, for various reasons that may not be their fault, including relocation of their family or death of their owner.<br>
      Occassionally, you'll find former breeding dogs, or purebreds/crossbreeds that have been given up by breeders, if they are too old to breed, or exhibit health issues
    that reduce their profitability for the breeders. </p><br>
       <p>They may be confused and scared at being taken away from their homes, and unfamiliar with objects and environments that we take for granted, like stairs and lifts, bicycles and buses, or even children.<br>
      All they really want is a safe space, square meals, and a kind hand to gently pet and protect them.</p>
