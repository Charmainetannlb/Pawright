    <center><h2>What is PawRight?</h2></center>
    <center> <p>PawRight helps families looking to adopt a dog in Singapore narrow down their options based on their current living situation and lifestyle.<br>
    Follow 4 simple steps to generate a list of dogs that you might like to meet at a local no-kill shelter!</p></center>

  <div class="box">
    <center><h2>Who are the dogs featured on PawRight?</h2></center>
    <center> <p>PawRight brings together dogs from three different shelters (more to come!):<br>
      <ul>
        <li> <b> Action for Singapore Dogs (ASD)</li> <br>
        <li>Save Our Street Dogs (SOSD)</li><br>
        <li>Singapore Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)</li></b></ul> 
      </ul>

      <center>These dogs are mostly "Singapore Specials" - local-breed street dogs known for being highly intelligent, athletic, and sensitive.<br>
       <p>They may have come off the streets because they seem to like people, or from homes that can no longer care for them.<br>  
      Occassionally, there are  also purebreds/crossbreeds that have been given up by breeders, due to age or health issues. </p><br>
       <p> But what they have in common, is a desire for a safe space, square meals, and a kind hand to gently pet and protect them.</p>
