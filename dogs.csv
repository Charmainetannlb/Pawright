Pickles,M,1 year (as of Dec 2023),Y,,,,,,,,,SPCA,https://spca.org.sg/animal/pickles/,https://spca.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20.jpg,"HDB Approved (Under PROJECT ADORE) ‚Äì¬†Please note that having window grilles is a mandatory requirement for PROJECT ADORE.
The hooman says:
Pickles and his two siblings, were brought to the shelter as part of the TNRM program. Adjusting to the shelter environment and human care was initially intimidating for them as they were used to roaming freely. With consistent care, training, and socialization, Pickles has gradually become more comfortable with his caregivers. 
His favorite parts of the day are playing with his doggy friends in the backyard and at mealtimes. Pickles has shown great improvement in his leash training and is able to go out for walks now. He is still afraid of being approached or touched by humans. To help him get comfortable, his meals were previously hand-fed to associate human hands with a positive experience and to build a bond with his caregivers. 
As a shy pup, he requires time and space to feel comfortable around people. Everyday objects that we take for granted, such as cars, bicycles, and elevators, may scare her. Despite this, the process is highly rewarding as you can witness him growing braver everyday when you spend a substantial amount of time and effort to work with him. 
When working with shy dogs, it is crucial to understand that progress may not always be linear and should be taken in small steps. For instance, while Pickles may feel at ease taking food from your hand today, he may withdraw from you the next day even if you offer him the same food. It‚Äôs important to be patient and accept that progress can be slow, and setbacks are normal. Consistency in socializing and training is important and very crucial to his growth.
Pickles is best suited for a quiet household, with experienced owners who are willing to engage force-free trainers to work with him. It would be helpful if there is another dog friend at home too!¬†

üêæ Note: I am still with AVS and not at SPCA.
Anakin says:I am a very affectionate, active and playful dog. I warm up to people quickly and absolutely adore playing with toys, including ones that the humans have put away and are a little challenging to reach. I love walks and would make a great walking or hiking companion. While I enjoy playing with familiar dogs, I am not comfortable around dogs I have never met and am still learning how to be calm around them.
Picking up tricks and basic skills is a piece of cake for me. I am highly intelligent, driven, and very food-motivated during training sessions. I enjoy learning new behaviours and have been building a strong foundation for entering a crate or vehicle voluntarily. My ideal match would be a loving family who can constantly give me the cuddles I deserve, while being consistent in continuing with my training plan.

Hazel,F,8 years 9 months (as of Feb 2024),N,,,,,,,,,SPCA,https://spca.org.sg/animal/hazel/,https://spca.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Hazel_1.jpg,"Not HDB Approved
Hazel says:
I was adopted as a puppy from SPCA. Unfortunately, my owner passed away when I was seven years old. His family returned me to SPCA as they could not look after me. A year later (May 2023), I went to my fosterer‚Äôs house.
Previous fosterer says:¬†
 Hazel is a quiet dog who seldom barks. She will watch me prepare meals in the kitchen or lie down peacefully when I am watching TV or having meals.¬† In the mornings, she waits outside the bedroom door and greets me when I step out. When I go out of the house, she will wait patiently for my return at the main door and greet me enthusiastically when I return home (as captured by CCTV). She does not suffer from separation anxiety.
Hazel is a good indoor dog and does not dirty the house or chew on furniture. When she is bored, she entertains herself by playing with towels or old T-shirts but will destroy chew toys in minutes.
She looks forward to her walks in the mornings and evenings and will verbalize her pleasure with an ‚ÄúArooooo‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù.¬† She prefers a short walk around the estate or nearby park to relieve herself and then return home. No long sniffaris for her. 
Hazel is wary of strangers, other dogs, loud sounds and unfamiliar surroundings.¬† During thunderstorms, her safe place is under the dining table. She will need training to cope with her anxieties.
Given time, Hazel will be a loving and devoted companion to singles, couples or families with older children.

I am an affectionate, playful and adaptable dog. Although I may be slightly timid when I meet new people, I warm up fairly quickly when they offer high-value treats and will eventually approach them for pets, and sit beside the people I am comfortable with.
I may be young, but I am generally calm around people and listen very well to cues like ‚Äúsit‚Äù, ‚Äúdown‚Äù and ‚Äúpaw‚Äù. L love walks and exploring the outdoors, I even do zoomies at dog runs! I also enjoy playing with familiar dogs, snuffle mats and dog chews.
I tend to get a little too excited when I go out for walks. I am still learning to be calm during walks and will need a firm handler.
I am fearful of thunder and would appreciate if I am given safe spaces such as crate to hide during thunderstorms.
I am most suited for a loving family who will give me the cuddles I deserve, and will be committed to continue my rewards-based training. I will do best with a family who will be patient and understanding to help me build up my confidence in unfamiliar environments and around unfamiliar people.

Cliff is a sweet and affectionate dog who loves nothing more than to spend his time with you. His hobbies include sniffing everything he sees, marking places he has been and tasting the fresh morning grass during his walks. Once he gets to know you well, he will love to rub his nose against your legs to show how much he loves you. He is curious about the real world because growing up in a shelter, he doesn‚Äôt get much social and outside world experience. Therefore, he needs someone to expose him to different situations, to make him feel comfortable in handling what the world has to offer. He conquered climbing down the stairs during his foster period which he initially feared which shows his ability to improve over time with patience.
He has no problems using a lift so he can live in an apartment. He does not chew furniture and cables and is quite chill when left alone. He does not exhibit too much separation anxiety but there is a bit of pacing at times when he is not entirely comfortable.
Cliff gets very excited when seeing other dogs or fast moving objects approaching him or certain people he doesn‚Äôt like. As a result, he may lunge selectively during walks so will needs a firm hand to control him if necessary.
He is rather strong and likes to walk so will benefit from an active family to live with. He is not fussy with food and happily eats kibbles but need to introduce to new types of foods slowly.
He may not be suitable for families with young children. He will do well with experienced owners who are patient and are willing to continue his training using humane, force-free, and positive reinforcement methods.

Peanut says:
I found myself at SPCA because my family had difficulty managing me. I didn‚Äôt react very well in certain situations, such as when being touched around my neck (it‚Äôs a sensitive area for me). But I do enjoy the humans who spend time with me, going on long walks perhaps even up to an hour! I love sniffaris too. For now, my ideal home would be a small family of 2‚Äì3 where it‚Äôs relatively quiet. I‚Äôm rather laidback and can snooze the day away if you give me a soft rug. If you wish to chill with me, email [email¬†protected] with ‚ÄòAdopt Peanut‚Äô as the subject title!

Gnocchi,M,1 year 2 months (as of Feb 2024),Y,,,,,,,,,SPCA,https://spca.org.sg/animal/gnocchi/,https://spca.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gnicchi.jpg,"HDB Approved (Under PROJECT ADORE) ‚Äì Please note that having window grilles is a mandatory requirement for PROJECT ADORE.
The hooman says:
Gnocchi and his two siblings, were brought to the shelter as part of the TNRM program. Adjusting to the shelter environment and human care was initially intimidating for them as they were used to roaming freely. With consistent care, training, and socialization, Gnocchi has gradually become more comfortable with his caregivers. 
His favorite parts of the day are playing with his doggy friends in the backyard and at mealtimes. Gnocchi has shown great improvement in his leash training and is able to go out for walks now. He is still afraid of being approached or touched by humans. To help him get comfortable, his meals were previously hand-fed to associate human hands with a positive experience and to build a bond with his caregivers. 
As a shy pup, he requires time and space to feel comfortable around people. Everyday objects that we take for granted, such as cars, bicycles, and elevators, may scare her. Despite this, the process is highly rewarding as you can witness him growing braver everyday when you spend a substantial amount of time and effort to work with him. 
When working with shy dogs, it is crucial to understand that progress may not always be linear and should be taken in small steps. For instance, while Gnocchi may feel at ease taking food from your hand today, but he may withdraw from you the next day even if you offer him the same food. It‚Äôs important to be patient and accept that progress can be slow, and setbacks are normal. Consistency in socializing and training is important and very crucial to his growth.
Gnocchi is is best suited for a quiet household, with experienced owners who are willing to engage force-free trainers to work with him. It would be helpful if there is another dog friend at home too!¬†

Macho,M,5 years 10 months (as of Feb 2024),N,,,,,,,,,SPCA,https://spca.org.sg/animal/macho/,https://spca.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Macho_1.jpg,"Not HDB Approved
Macho is a strong willed boy who loves his meaty treats and daily walks. He walks fairly well on a leash, but is still working on practising to tug less. This is because he gets overly excited when he‚Äôs outdoors and is more comfortable relieving himself on grass.
Macho will need someone who is patient enough to give him all the time he needs to warm up to them and cultivate mutual trust. Despite his strong front, he is afterall like a broken child who was left to fend for himself, wondering what he had done wrong.
Macho will also need someone to be firm and consistent with his training. This is to ensure that clear boundaries are set in order for him to thrive in a healthy environment.
He might not be suitable for families with elderly and/or young children residing together. Sudden movement and loud noises may scare him, and his energy would match up to a family who is active and physically fit enough to manage him during walks.

Pancake,M,11 years 11 months (as of Feb 2024),N,,,,,,,,,SPCA,https://spca.org.sg/animal/pancake/,https://spca.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pancake_1.jpg,"Not HDB Approved
Pancake is a well-mannered, obedient, and loving boy who never fails to welcome you home with his affectionate rubs and wagging tail. When out on walks, he is friendly towards other dogs and humans, albeit a little timid. He may be overwhelmed if he is approached in an overexcited or threatening manner.
Being a loyal and protective boy, he may bark when strangers try to enter the house without a proper introduction. But once he gets to know you, he is a sweetie pie who will always do his best to please and love you.
Pancake was brought to SPCA as a puppy. Since he was young, he would regularly suffer from bouts of skin flare-ups due to allergy. His condition is now under control with the appropriate medical attention and care.
With his superb intelligence, it is difficult to fool this smart boy. Give him a new toy stuffed with food and he will figure out how to get to the food in no time. He is not a fussy eater and will happily munch on any meat, fruit and vegetables.
However, due to his food allergy, his diet has to be carefully managed.
? Pancake is currently with his fosterer and not at the SPCA. If you are interested in giving this sweet boy a forever home, please email [email¬†protected] with ‚ÄòAdopt Pancake‚Äô as the email subject.

Hooman says:
Hero is a charming boy who may strike you as intimidating when you meet him for the first time due to his built and cautious nature. However, once he has warmed up to you, he exhibits puppy like behavior and loves to be showered with attention. He is a high energy pup who would benefit from being walked at least twice a day and be allowed to stimulate his senses by exploring his surroundings. This furbaby would be suitable for a quiet household who can shower him with attention but at the same time respect the space that he needs. The mutual adjustment between him and your family will also be much easier if you are an experienced dog handler.
